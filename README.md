# React-Portfolio
![homePagePic-for-README](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbd73410-4280-41a1-b493-a6ad3c03296d)
## Description

This is my personal projects portfolio, showcased through a react web application that contains an About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume page. The About Me section provides a bit of information on me. The Portfolio section contains projects I've completed with links to their GitHub repositories and a live demo that either allows you to try the application or see a video if it's terminal based. The Contact section lets you send me a message via email (Node.js not installed, so emails do not send as of today). The Resume section contains a download button for my personal resume in pdf format. There are also links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles in the footer.

## Installation

To install this application you must download the repository's files. Which can be done by selecting the green [<>Code] button, and selecting the "Download Zip" option. This will automatically download the files into a zip folder that can be accessed in your "Downloads" folder. Move that zip folder to the location you have or will have a git repository linked. Once the zip folder is in it's desired location, you can open the folder in your source code editor. The files and their contents should display. Before starting the application, be sure to install the necessary packages. This can be done with npm install. As a double check, there should be npm i bootstrap, tailwindcss, axios, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, eslint, and vite. Once the package is installed, the application is ready for further use.

## Usage

The user is taken to my home page, and then is presented with navbar options: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume
The user can click each navbar link, and be taken to each page.
